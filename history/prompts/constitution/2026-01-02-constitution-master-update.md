## Prompt

Generate a MASTER CONSTITUTION in Markdown format for the project:
“The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud-Native AI”

Context:
This is a multi-phase hackathon project (Phase I–V) evolving a Todo app
from a simple in-memory CLI to a distributed, Kubernetes-managed,
AI-powered, event-driven cloud-native system.

Core Philosophy:
- AI-Native Development
- Spec-Driven Development
- Agentic Dev Stack
- Reusable Intelligence
- Human = Architect, AI = Implementer

MANDATORY RULES TO ENFORCE:
1. No manual code writing by humans under any circumstance
2. Every feature must start from a written specification
3. Specs must be iteratively refined until Claude Code produces correct output
4. All implementations must be generated by Claude Code
5. Prompts, specs, plans, and iterations must be reviewable
6. Constitution applies globally to ALL phases (Phase I–V)

Include the following sections clearly:

1. Purpose of the Constitution
2. Roles & Responsibilities
   - Human (Product Architect)
   - AI (Claude Code as Implementation Agent)
3. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
   - Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Review → Refine
4. Agentic Dev Stack Rules
5. Reusable Intelligence Policy
   - Agent Skills
   - Subagents
6. Architectural Integrity Rules
7. Evaluation & Judging Criteria
8. Forbidden Actions
9. Evolution & Phase Governance
   - How this constitution governs future phases
10. Success Definition

Tone:
- Authoritative
- Professional
- Industry-grade
- Clear and enforceable (not academi

## Response snapshot

Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the "Evolution of Todo" Master Constitution. The document establishes strict AI-native and spec-driven governance for all phases (I-V). Propagated changes to `plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, and `tasks-template.md` to ensure template-level compliance with the new rules. Included a Sync Impact Report in the constitution file tracking the version bump from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established global governance for the hackathon project.
- 🧪 Tests: Local validation of Markdown structure and placeholder removal.
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution and 3 dependent templates.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Use /sp.specify for Phase I features.
- 🧠 Reflection: The transition from generic templates to a project-specific master constitution provides the necessary constraints for pure AI-driven development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

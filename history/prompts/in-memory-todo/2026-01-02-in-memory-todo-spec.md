## Prompt

You are a senior software architect and Spec-Driven Development expert.

Write a COMPLETE and REVIEWABLE specification in Markdown
for Phase I of the project: “The Evolution of Todo”.

Phase Context:
- Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App
- Storage must be in-memory only
- Interface must be command-line based
- No manual code writing allowed
- Implementation will be generated by Claude Code

Functional Requirements:
1. Add Task (title required, description optional)
2. View Tasks (ID, title, description, completion status)
3. Update Task (by ID)
4. Delete Task (by ID)
5. Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Clean code principles
- Modular architecture
- Python 3.13+
- UV-compatible project
- Clear CLI output

Constraints:
- No persistence (no files, no DB)
- No external frameworks
- In-memory data structures only

Success Criteria:
- Fully working CLI app
- All features demonstrable via terminal
- Runnable using `python -m todo`

Output Requirements:
- Markdown format
- Clear sections
- No implementation code
- Precise, enforceable language
# Phase I Specification — In-Memory Todo CLI App

## Objective
Design and implement a Python-based command-line Todo application that stores tasks in memory only.

## User Role
User interacts via terminal commands.

## Functional Requirements
The system must support:

1. Add Task
   - Input: title (required), description (optional)
   - Output: confirmation with task ID

2. View Tasks
   - Display all tasks
   - Show: ID, title, description, status (✔ / ⏳)

3. Update Task
   - Update title and/or description by ID

4. Delete Task
   - Remove task by ID

5. Mark Complete / Incomplete
   - Toggle completion status by ID

## Non-Functional Requirements
- In-memory storage only (no files, no DB)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Readable CLI output
- Python 3.13+
- Compatible with UV environment

## Constraints
- No external frameworks
- No persistence
- No manual code writing

## Success Criteria
- All commands function correctly
- CLI app runs via `python -m todo`
- Code structure is clean and modular

## Response snapshot

Created the Phase I specification at `specs/001-in-memory-todo/spec.md`. The spec defines three prioritized user stories: Manage Basic Tasks (P1), Task Completion Status (P2), and Edit Task Details (P3). It captures functional requirements, key entities, and measurable success criteria aligned with the Master Constitution. Validated the spec using a quality checklist at `specs/001-in-memory-todo/checklists/requirements.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Solid foundation for Phase I implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: Validated against quality checklist; no clarifications needed.
- 📁 Files: Spec and quality checklist created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Use /sp.plan to design the implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Maintaining strict separation between spec and implementation is key. No implementation leaks occurred.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial script failure due to positional parameter placement.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

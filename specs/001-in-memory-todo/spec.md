# Feature Specification: In-Memory Todo CLI App

**Feature Branch**: `001-in-memory-todo`
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App. Storage must be in-memory only. Interface must be command-line based. No manual code writing allowed. Implementation will be generated by Claude Code."

## Architectural Context
- **Phase**: Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App
- **Constitution Alignment**: This spec adheres to the Master Constitution v1.0.0.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Manage Basic Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add, view, and delete tasks so that I can track my daily activities.

**Why this priority**: Correctness of task lifecycle is the core value of Phase I.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a task, listing it to verify presence, and deleting it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no tasks exist, **When** I add a task with title "Buy milk", **Then** I should see a confirmation with a unique ID.
2. **Given** a task exists, **When** I view all tasks, **Then** I should see the task ID, title, and current status.
3. **Given** a task with ID 1 exists, **When** I delete task 1, **Then** it should no longer appear in the list.

### User Story 2 - Task Completion Status (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so that I can see what I have finished.

**Why this priority**: Essential for meaningful todo tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling a task's status and verifying the visual change in the list view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an incomplete task, **When** I mark it as complete, **Then** its status should show "✔".
2. **Given** a complete task, **When** I mark it as incomplete, **Then** its status should show "⏳".

### User Story 3 - Edit Task Details (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to update task titles and descriptions so that I can correct mistakes or add details.

**Why this priority**: Useful for flexibility, but less critical than creation or completion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating a task and viewing the changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task with title "A", **When** I update its title to "B", **Then** the list view should show "B".

---

### Edge Cases

- **Invalid ID**: What happens when updating/deleting a non-existent ID? (The system must show an error message).
- **Empty Title**: What happens if I try to add a task with an empty title? (The system must reject the input).
- **Duplicate Tasks**: Multiple tasks with same title are allowed but must have unique IDs.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow adding a task with a mandatory title and optional description.
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign a unique integer ID to every new task.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support viewing all tasks in a table or list format.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow deleting a task using its unique ID.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow updating a task's title and description by ID.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow toggling task status between "Complete" and "Incomplete".
- **FR-007**: All data MUST be stored in memory only (no persistence between runs).

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item.
  - Attributes: `id` (integer), `title` (string), `description` (string), `is_completed` (boolean).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All functional features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Toggle) can be demonstrated via the terminal.
- **SC-002**: The application starts and is ready for input in under 1 second.
- **SC-003**: 100% of the code for Phase I is generated by Claude Code with no manual human edits.
- **SC-004**: Users can perform a full task lifecycle (add, view, complete, delete) in under 30 seconds of interaction time.
- **SC-005**: Application runs successfully using `python -m todo`.

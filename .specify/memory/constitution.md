# The Evolution of Todo Constitution

Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud-Native AI

## 1. Purpose of the Constitution
This constitution serves as the foundational governance document for "The Evolution of Todo" project. It establishes the mandatory rules of engagement for human architects and AI implementers to ensure architectural integrity, technical excellence, and pure spec-driven evolution from a simple CLI to a distributed cloud-native system.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### Human (Product Architect)
The human is responsible for prompting, reviewing outputs, requesting refinements, and making high-level architectural decisions. Humans are strictly forbidden from writing code.

### AI (Claude Code as Implementation Agent)
Claude Code is the primary implementation agent responsible for all code generation, refactoring, and technical execution based on provided specifications.

## 3. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
All development must follow this strict sequence:
1. **Spec**: Define clear functional and technical requirements.
2. **Plan**: Design the implementation strategy and architectural approach.
3. **Tasks**: Break down the plan into actionable, atomic tasks.
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks via Claude Code.
5. **Review**: Human validates output against the spec.
6. **Refine**: Iterate on the spec/prompt until the output is correct.

## 4. Agentic Dev Stack Rules
The development environment is AI-native. Every tool, hook, and script must be designed to be consumed and executed by AI agents. Manual boilerplate is rejected.

## 5. Reusable Intelligence Policy

### Agent Skills
Custom skills and MCP servers should be developed to encapsulate reusable intelligence and domain-specific capabilities.

### Subagents
Complex tasks should be delegated to specialized subagents (Explore, Plan, Research) to maintain focus and context efficiency.

## 6. Architectural Integrity Rules
Architecture must evolve logically across phases (Phase I–V). Phase transition requires a constitution check to ensure the foundations (Spec-Driven, AI-Native) remain intact.

## 7. Evaluation & Judging Criteria
Projects are evaluated on:
- Quality and depth of specifications.
- Prompt clarity and effective iteration history.
- Architectural cleanliness and "AI-readability" of code.
- Functional correctness and adherence to the master constitution.

## 8. Forbidden Actions
- **NO MANUAL CODE WRITING**: Humans must never manually edit source files.
- **NO BYPASSING SPECS**: No feature implementation without a corresponding specification.
- **NO EXTERNAL BOILERPLATE**: AI must generate structured code rather than copy-pasting generic external snippets without context.

## 9. Evolution & Phase Governance
This constitution governs all phases of the hackathon. It remains the source of truth as the project scales from a monolith to a distributed system. Amendments require a major version bump.

## 10. Success Definition
Success is defined as a fully functional, cloud-native system where 100% of the codebase and its evolutionary history (specs, plans, tasks) was architected by humans but implemented autonomously by AI.
